I just submitted my first R package `xutils` to CRAN and got accepted!
The package website is [here](https://fangzhou-xie.github.io/xutils/).

This is a package that contains several (currently only one) functions
that I found useful and don't have mature solution out there.
Hence I decided to put together such a package for future use easier.


# Fast and efficient function for decoding HTML entities in R

I have introduced a function `html_decode` in the package, 
where it maps HTML entities back to their original UTF-8 characters.

An example would be:

```{r}
# load library
library(xutils)
# create test strings
strings <- c("abcd", "&amp; &apos; &gt;", "&amp;", "&euro; &lt;")
# decode
html_decode(strings)
```
