My name is Fangzhou Xie. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Department of
Economics at Rutgers University, starting from Fall 2020.
Previously, I did my M.A. at the Department of Economics at New York University.

I am a fan of R/Rcpp/RcppEigen/RcppThread and I am also a developer of R packages. Here is a list of packages I publish and maintain on CRAN:

1. [rethnicity](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rethnicity/index.html): predict ethnicity from names, [Github](https://github.com/fangzhou-xie/rethnicity)
2. [Randomuseragent](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Randomuseragent/index.html): generate random useragent string, [Github](https://github.com/fangzhou-xie/Randomuseragent)
3. [xutils](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xutils/index.html): misc personal functions, [Github](https://github.com/fangzhou-xie/xutils)

Besides, I am also a beginner boulderer (currently V4/V5).
