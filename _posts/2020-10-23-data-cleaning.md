This is the first blog for my personal website and
I would like to talk about the usage of Econometrics
for data cleaning.

"Shouldn't Econometrics be the models we used for analysis?",
you may ask.
You are not mistaken here as we are going to apply
Econometric techniques for data cleaning process.
I was surprised by this idea when I first encountered it,
but I soon realized that on one hand some empirical problems are so difficult
to tackle that we really have to employ some advanced machineries;
while on the other hand, data cleaning should be considered
as an integral part of the data analysis procedure
and the outcome of cleaning will determine the data quality
for your analysis stage.
Hence, you need to be careful for the cleaning stage
(otherwise "garbage in, garbage out").

So the problem arises when I worked with Professor Sahar Parsa at NYU.
